<h2> My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>High & Low - John Galliano</h3>
<p>In the midst of reviewing a horror film, I was given a reassignment of the documentary <br>"High and Low - 
    John Galliano" by Academy-Award Winning Director Kevin Macdonald. <br> have never been afraid to write a review, let alone 
    give it a rating, but this documentary took me for a spin. I had not wrapped my head around the fact that the fashion industry 
    is wicked, even after watching "America’s Next Top Model" throughout my entire adolescence. "High and Low - John Galliano" highlights 
    antisemite, culture-vulture-designer, and former alcoholic John Galliano. The ills of the fashion industry headed by near-trillionaire 
    Bernard Arnault (CEO LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton), are alarming and are articulated pretty clearly by director Kevin Macdonald. </p>


    <h3>Arcadian</h3>
<p>For a few minutes, “Arcadian” basically becomes “Aliens” on an Irish farm with Nicolas Cage in the Ripley role. 
    That might be the best elevator pitch I've ever heard. You know if you want to sign up for that or not. Don’t get me wrong. 
    This is not James Cameron-level filmmaking, but it is an effective creature feature that avoids a lot of the traps of post-apocalyptic 
    horror (which has really been a thing lately, especially at this year’s SXSW) and delivers on its premise. It truly feels like 
    “The Walking Dead” and now maybe “The Last of Us” have spawned a wave of films about how humans respond when civilization
     collapses—“Arcadian”
     is one of the better entries in this growing genre about how screwed we all are. </p>





    <h3>Road House</h3>
<p>While that may sound harsh, some of the Looney Tunes-esque qualities of this reimagining of the 1989 Patrick Swayze 
    classic work in its favor. Especially in the first hour, when director Doug Liman and Anthony Bagarozzi & Charles Mondry 
    are setting the table for what’s to come, there’s a fun B-movie throwback aesthetic to “Road House” that clicks for long stretches.
     However, once this defiantly goofy movie starts to take itself seriously, and asks us too often to do the same, the wheels come off 
     with ridiculous twists, awkward line readings, and some of the worst fight CGI in years. Through it all, Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a 
     fun performance that goes from charming to menacing, but even that gets lost in the chaos of a movie that needed to be sweaty, 
    grounded, and urgent to work but becomes more and more like something you’d watch on Saturday morning. </p>
